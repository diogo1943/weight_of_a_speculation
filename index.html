            &rarr; As design is a future oriented discipline every action demands a pondered decision, and as a designer every artifact you produce, has an impact on the world, being it enviromentaly or socially oriented. During the develoment of these artifacts, you must consider every option and how these will consequentionally impact the world around you. Since you have the choice, you also have the responsability, not only as a designer, but as a fellow human being.
